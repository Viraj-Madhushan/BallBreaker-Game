# Ball Breaker

Ball Breaker is a classic arcade-style game developed in Java 11. Use the left and right arrow keys to control the paddle, keep the ball in play, and break all the bricks to earn points. If you miss the ball, you lose the game, but you can restart it anytime by pressing the Enter key.

### Game Features

   - Paddle Control: Move the paddle left and right using the arrow keys to keep the ball in play.
   - Brick Breaking: Aim the ball at the brick wall to break the bricks and score points.
   - Ball Dynamics: The ball changes direction based on its impact with the paddle, bricks, and walls.
   - Restart Game: Press the Enter key to restart the game after a loss.
   - Score Tracking: Keep track of your score as you break more bricks.

### How to Play

   - Start the Game: Launch the game and a ball will start moving.
   - Control the Paddle: Use the left (←) and right (→) arrow keys to move the paddle.
   - Break Bricks: Bounce the ball off the paddle and hit the bricks to break them and earn points.
   - Avoid Missing the Ball: Ensure the ball does not fall below the paddle, or you will lose the game.
   - Restarting the Game: If you lose, press the Enter key to restart and play again.
